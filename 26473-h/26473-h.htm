RAY (RHAGES) ANTERIOR TO THE XIITH CENTURY</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HIS exhibition has been arranged with a desire to meet the
convenience of those who are interested in manifestations of the arts
of different countries over which <span class="smcap">Islam</span> held sway at one time or other
in the past. An effort has been made to show under one roof
representative examples of works produced at different epochs and
stages of the civilizations referred to, so that they may be seen, and
perhaps studied, with the minimum expenditure of time.</p>

<p>Fine examples of many branches of the arts of these peoples are in
permanent exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum, New York, and the
museums of great cities throughout the country. It is difficult to
find adequate words to describe the enchanting atmosphere of the halls
at the Metropolitan Museum where Near Eastern art is installed; and
the same can truly be said of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and the
University of Pennsylvania Museum, Philadelphia. These exhibitions
must inevitably contribute to the enjoyment and education of countless
visitors to these institutions, and will continue to do so in
increasing degree to the enjoyment of generations to come.</p>

<p>The present exhibition does not comprise a vast number of objects. Its
claim to attention lies in the fact that it includes an important
series of really first class works which are also of great historical
importance. There will be on view as well some comparatively new types
of objects of &aelig;sthetic and arch&aelig;ological interest, obtained as the
result of recent excavations.</p>

<p>The briefness of time available precluded the possibility of compiling
a catalogue, as was at first intended. The present booklet is issued
to explain the scope of the exhibition, and extend a cordial
invitation to visit it.</p>

AND SUCCESSOR) DEFEAT AMR BEN ABDWAD</p>

<p>One of the eight illustrations for a XIIIth Century Persian Manuscript
entitled, "<span class="smcap">History of Tabari</span>", compiled A.H. 310 (A.D. 922). The
present copy is a subsequent one of the Persian version, translated by
<span class="smcap">al B'ala'mi</span>, A.H. 352.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that <span class="smcap">Tabari</span> records in the book here
referred to, that three messages were sent by <span class="smcap">Muhammad</span> to <span class="smcap">Khusraw
Parniz</span>, imparting the divine warnings. One of the messages, as
recorded in an old Manuscript entitled <span class="smcap">Nihayat ul-Irab</span>, reads:</p>

<p>"In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. From <span class="smcap">Muhammad</span>
the Apostle of God to <span class="smcap">Khusraw</span> son of <span class="smcap">Hurmazd</span>. But to proceed. Verily I
extol unto thee God, beside whom there is no other God. He it is who
guarded me when I was an orphan, and made me rich when I was
destitute, and guided me when I was straying in error. Only he who is
bereft of understanding, and over whom calamity triumphs, rejects the
message which I am sent to announce. O <span class="smcap">Khusraw</span>, submit and thou shalt
be safe, or else prepare to wage with God and with his Apostle a war
which shall not find them helpless. Farewell."</p>

<p>The rise of <span class="smcap">Islam</span> and its rapid advent to power, is perhaps the most
surprising chapter of the history of mankind. The great empires,
Persian and Byzantine, which were subjected to the urgent onslaught of
this rising power may have been in an enfeebled condition as a result
of excess of despotism and internal dissensions, as historians affirm;
but that the element of the power must have been in the rationality of
the principles contained in the teaching, there can be no doubt.</p>

<p>"It was undoubtedly to <span class="smcap">Islam</span>, that simple yet majestic creed of which
no unprejudiced student can ignore the grandeur, that Arabs owed the
splendid part which they were destined to play in the history of
civilization. In judging of the Arabian Prophet, western critics are
too often inclined to ignore the condition from which he raised his
country, and to forget that many institutions which they condemn were
not introduced but only tolerated by <span class="smcap">Islam</span>. The early Muslims were
very sensible of the immense amelioration in their life effected by
<span class="smcap">Muhammad's</span> teachings. What this same amelioration was is well shown in
the following passage from the oldest extant biography of the
Prophet," says Professor G. Browne in his memorable work on Persia,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
and quotes <span class="smcap">Ibn Hisham</span> (A.H. 213: A.D. 828) in support.</p>

AS-SAFFAH FIRST CALIPH OF THE HOUSE OF ABBAS</p>

<p>One of eight illustrations for a XIIIth Century Manuscript entitled,
"<span class="smcap">History of Tabari</span>", compiled A.H. 310 (A.D. 922). The present copy is
a subsequent one of the Persian version, translated by <span class="smcap">al B'ala'mi</span>,
A.H. 352.</p>

<p>"It was a dynasty abounding in good qualities, richly endowed with
generous attributes, wherein the wares of science found a ready sale,
the merchandise of culture was in great demand, the observances of
religion were respected, charitable bequests flowed freely ... and the
frontiers were bravely kept."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Al-Fakhri</span> (historian of fame of the
XIIIth Century) on the <span class="smcap">Abbasid</span> Dynasty.</p>

<p class="tp">his excellent work on <span class="smcap">Islam</span>,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> "everything followed its accustomed
course in the Byzantine as in the Persian Empire. These two states
continued always to dispute the possession of western Asia; they were,
to all outward appearance, flourishing; the taxes which poured into
the treasuries of their Kings reached considerable sums, and the
magnificence, as well as the luxury of their capitals had become
proverbial. But all this was but in appearance, for secret disease
consumed both empires; they were burdened by a crushing despotism; on
either hand the history of the dynasties formed a concatenation of
horrors, that of the state a series of persecutions born of
dissensions in religious matters. At this juncture it was that, all of
a sudden, there emerged from deserts hardly known and appeared on the
scene of the world a new people, hitherto divided into innumerable
nomad tribes, who, for the most part, had been at war with one
another, now for the first time united. It was this people,
passionately attached to liberty, simple in their food and dress,
noble and hospitable, gay and witty, but at the same time proud,
irascible, and, once their passions were aroused, vindictive,
irreconcilable and cruel, who overthrew in an instant the venerable
but rotten empire of the Persians, snatched from the successors of
Constantine their fairest provinces, trampled under their feet a
Germanic kingdom but lately founded, and menaced the rest of Europe,
while at the same time, at the other end of the world, its victorious
armies penetrated to the Himalayas. Yet it was not like so many other
conquering peoples, for it preached at the same time a new religion.
In opposition to the dualism of the Persians and a degenerate
Christianity, it announced a pure monotheism which was accepted by
millions of men, and which, even in our own time, constitutes the
religion of a tenth part of the human race."</p>

conversion in the scheme of conquest of early converts. "It is often
supposed," says Professor <span class="smcap">Browne</span>, "that the choice offered by the
warriors of <span class="smcap">Islam</span> was between the <span class="smcap">Qur'an</span> and the <span class="smcap">Sword</span>; this, however,
is not the fact." There are innumerable evidences to the contrary
which history records.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> It appears that the exemplary behavior of
the Arabs, under their newly acquired faith, was the main factor not
only in the success of their scheme of conquest, but also in the
impression which it made on the defeated in determining them to adopt
the faith which produced such upright warriors.</p>

<p>The tremendous political upheaval that the evolution of <span class="smcap">Islam</span> brought
in its train to the affairs of the world does not fall within the
scope of this paper. A highly important fact, however, must not be
lost sight of, that by consolidating and unifying the tottering states
a new civilization was founded which knew how to turn to account the
culture of the ancient states conquered. In this overwhelming
transformation Persia came in, from the outset, to play the most
conspicuous and important part. The</p>

<p><b>ILLUSTRATIONS FOR TITLE-PAGES OF A SHAHNAMA</b> (<span class="smcap">Epic of Kings</span>) of the
XVth Century.</p>

<p>Representing <span class="smcap">Timur-i-Lang</span> (A.H. 736-807) attending a festival. The
name and the full titles of <span class="smcap">Timur</span> appear in excellent Thuluth
lettering round the border of the rug upon which the monarch sits.</p>

<p>This important Manuscript was presented by the Emperor of Russia to
the Ambassador of Persia at St. Petersburg, A.D. 1829. The
Ambassador's autograph inscription reads:</p>

<p>"The <span class="smcap">Shahnama</span> graciously presented by H.M. the Emperor at my third
visit&mdash;may it be omen of good fortune. <span class="smcap">Muhammad Ali ibni Ghafouri</span>
Ambassador, 22nd of <span class="smcap">Rajab</span>, A.H. 1245."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Timur Beg</span> was seated in a portal, in front of the entrance of a
beautiful Palace; and he was sitting on the ground.... The lord was
seated cross-legged, on silken embroidered carpets, amongst round
pillows. He was dressed in a robe of silk, with white headdress on his
head, on the top of which there was a spinel ruby, with pearls and
precious stones round it. As soon as the ambassadors saw the lord,
they made a reverential bow, placing the knee on the ground, and
crossing the arms on the breast; then they went forward and made
another and then a third, remaining with their knees on the ground.
The lord ordered them to rise and come forward.... Three <span class="smcap">Mirzas</span>, or
secretaries, ... came and took the ambassadors by the arms, and led
them forward until they stood before the lord.... He asked after the
King, saying, 'How is my son the King? is he in good health?' When the
ambassadors had answered, <span class="smcap">Timur Beg</span> turned to the knights who were
seated around him, amongst whom were one of the sons of <span class="smcap">Toktamish</span>, the
former Emperor of <span class="smcap">Tartary</span>, several chiefs of the blood of the late
Emperor of <span class="smcap">Samarquand</span>, and others of the family of the lord himself,
and said, 'Behold, here are the ambassadors sent by my son, the King
of Spain, who is the greatest King of Franks, and lives at the end of
the world. These Franks are truly great people, and I will give my
benediction to the King of Spain, my son."&mdash;From the Diary of <span class="smcap">Ruy
Gonzalez di Clavijo</span>, principal of the embassy despatched A.D. 1404 to
the Court of <span class="smcap">Samarquand</span> by Henry III of Castile, Spain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clavijo</span> describes the beautiful gardens with their tiled palaces where
banquets were given. The ambassador, who was invited, marvelled at the
gorgeous tents, one of which "was so large and high that from a
distance it looked like a castle, and it was a very wonderful thing to
see, and possessed more beauty than it is possible to describe". It is
interesting to notice that <span class="smcap">Sharaf-u-din</span> mentions the presence of the
Ambassadors, "for," he writes, "even the smallest of fish have their
place in the sea". Truly a delightful touch!&mdash;History of Persia, by

<p>"When one walks in these places expressly made for the delights of
love and when one passes through all these cabinets and niches, one's
heart is melted to such an extent that to speak candidly, one always
leaves with a very ill grace. The climate without doubt contributes
much towards exciting this amorous disposition, but assuredly these
places, although in some respects little more than cardboard castles,
are nevertheless more smiling and agreeable than our most sumptuous
palaces."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Curzon</span> says (History of Persia, Vol. II, page 37) that "Even
<span class="smcap">Chardin</span>, enthusiastic but seldom sentimental, was inspired to an
unwonted outburst by the charms of <span class="smcap">Hasht Bahisht</span>".<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ker Porter</span>, who saw the Palace of Chahal Situn in its perfect

into these planets of countries and races of the System, her
all-stimulating cultural beams, the reflection of which is discernible
in all artistic manifestations of those countries. In the field of
literature, which is so little known in the western world, the

Probably of equal importance is the fact that, although practised by

<h3>ILLUSTRATED AND ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPT</h3>

<p>The complete volume of "<span class="smcap">Yusuf-ou-Zalikha</span>", the popular poem by the
famous mystic poet <span class="smcap">J'Ami</span>, based on the Biblical story of <span class="smcap">Joseph</span> and
<span class="smcap">Potiphar's wife</span>. The scribe, <span class="smcap">Mir Ali Sultani</span>.</p>

<p>The colophon reads:</p>

<p>"Terminated by the sinner, humble <span class="smcap">Mir Ali Sultani</span> the penman, may God
forgive his sins and shelter his faults. Terminated in the month of
<span class="smcap">Moharram al Haram</span> in the year A.H. 944 (in letters) (A.D. 1537) in the
glorious city of <span class="smcap">Bukhara</span>."</p>

<p>The Dedication in the handwriting of the scribe, in ornate gold
lettering, reads:</p>

<p>"For his majesty, the <span class="smcap">August</span>, the just, the possessor of virtues, the
great <span class="smcap">Khagan Ghazi Abd-ul-Aziz Bahadur Khan</span>, may his domain last
forever."</p>

<p>The autograph of the Emperor <span class="smcap">Shah Jahan</span>, the "<span class="smcap">Great Mogul</span>", on the
magnificently decorated mount reads:</p>

<p>"In the name of God compassionate and merciful this <span class="smcap">Yusuf-ou-Zalikha</span>
treasured on the occasion of <span class="smcap">Blessed Accession</span>." (A.D. 1627)</p>

<p>In confirmation of the foregoing, it is of great interest that
<span class="smcap">Jahangir</span> makes special reference in his memoirs (Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri) to
an incident, as of highest importance, that he was presented by
<span class="smcap">Abd-al-Rahim Khan</span>, <span class="smcap">Khan-i-Khanan</span>, with a superb copy of <span class="smcap">J'Ami's</span> poem
<span class="smcap">Yusuf-ou-Zalikha</span>, transcribed by <span class="smcap">Mir Ali Sultani</span>, "Prince of Penmen",

into existence and continued for a period of <span class="smcap">six</span> centuries
uninterrupted. The nations of this united kingdom of <span class="smcap">Islam</span> were thus
merged into one unit, under the stimulus of one formal religion,
freely transmigrating local ideas. Arts and culture were transformed,
but the evolution thus caused by the Religion was essentially
political in nature.</p>

<p>"There is no God but <span class="smcap">God</span>," said the <span class="smcap">Apostle of Arabia</span>, but the poet
reflected awhile, and his rejoinder was: "The Ways of God are as the
number of <span class="smcap">souls of men</span>."</p>

<p>The Prophet's religion was rational, its principles attainable; it
secured for the poet social amelioration and physical comfort, but
there was a voice from the depth of his soul that he could not
silence. It was the voice of mystery; he was concerned with the
problems of the "Wherefore, the Whence, and the Whither".... Was he
not a Son of the land which <span class="smcap">Plotinus</span> visited to learn mystery of the

<p>We have to look therefore to the <span class="smcap">Religion</span>, "The Ways" of whose God
"are as the number of Souls of Men", to perceive the true nature of
the evolution of the artistic expression of these people.</p>

<p>Souls with irresistible cravings for Mysticism, poets, artists,
philosophers and the like, discovered for the first time from
<span class="smcap">Muhammad's</span> formal teachings, which contained certain esoteric
elements, that the senses, unreal and phenomenal, have yet an
important mission to fulfill in the task which aims to escape from
<span class="smcap">Self</span> (which is an illusion and the root of <span class="smcap">sin</span>, <span class="smcap">pain</span>, and <span class="smcap">sorrow</span>) and

<p>The unreality of things material, the illusion of Self and desires,
the perception that all living things and apparent phenomena reflected
but one all-embracing <span class="smcap">Good</span> and <span class="smcap">Beauty</span>, was the philosophy of Hindu and
all Oriental mystics of old; but they attempted to destroy the self
and desires (Source of Sin) uncompromisingly and unreasonably. It was
a philosophy "cold" and "bloodless", as Professor <span class="smcap">Browne</span> points out,
in trenchant terms. The <span class="smcap">Muhammadan</span> mystic became conscious that the
stream cannot be crossed without the aid of the <span class="smcap">Bridge</span> constructed for
this purpose.</p>

<p>Here (as it seems to us) lies the <span class="smcap">Keynote</span>, the mainspring of
inspiration of artistic expression, which (for the lack of better
designation) might be termed <span class="smcap">Muhammadan Art</span>: A merging of physical and
spiritual, of worldly magnificence and eternal bliss.</p>

29 feet by 9 feet 5 inches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Curzon</span> in his History of Persia, Vol. II, page 38, gives the
following description of the Garden of <span class="smcap">Chahar Bagh</span>:</p>

<p>"At the upper extremity a two storeyed <span class="smcap">Pavilion</span> connected by a
corridor with the <span class="smcap">Seraglio</span> of the palace, so as to enable the ladies
of the harem to gaze unobserved upon the merry scene below, looked out
upon the centre of the avenue. Water conducted in stone channels ran
down the centre, falling in cascades from terrace to terrace, and was
occasionally collected in great square or octagonal basins where cross
roads cut the avenues. On either side of the central channel was a row
of chenars and a paved pathway for pedestrians, then occurred a
succession of open parterres, usually planted or sown. Next on either
side was a second row of chenars, between which and flanking walls was
a raised causeway for horsemen. At intervals corresponding with the
successive terraces and basins, arched doorways with recessed open
chambers overhead conducted through these walls into the various royal
or noble gardens that stretched on either side and were known as the
gardens of the throne; nightingale, vines, mulberries, Dervishes, etc.
Some of these pavilions were places of public resort and were used as
coffee houses, where when the business of the day was over the good
burghers of Ispahan assembled to sip that beverage and inhale their
Kalians the while. At the bottom quays lined the banks of the river
and were bordered with the mansions of the nobility."</p>

<p class="tp">A desire to reach to our higher instincts through the vehicle of our
senses is apparent in all forms in which these masters sought to
express themselves; we feel that, in their entrancing rhythmical
compositions, in their incomparable poetry of flowing melodious words,
in all their literature, in the inimitable colors and lyrical lines of
all branches of representation of visual art. We feel the presence of
an element prevailing throughout, and underlying every form of
expression, an element which may be described in a word, "<span class="smcap">Human</span>".</p>

<p>It is stated that the <span class="smcap">Persian</span> spirit and feeling were reflected in all
forms of artistic expression of the <span class="smcap">Muhammadan</span> world. It is not,
however, intended that other nations and countries over which <span class="smcap">Islam</span>
held sway, contributed nothing in the building of the influences of

each were felt in varying degrees in the transformation that resulted.
In the fusion referred to, the influence of the <span class="smcap">Persian</span> culture was
predominant, a fact so transparent, as to require (we may assume) no
emphasis.</p>

<p>It is not intended to deal here with particular aspects or divers
branches of arts in which the genius of these artists found
expression. In offering briefly these lines as to the general aspect
of the Art of the <span class="smcap">Muhammadan</span> world, the intention is to offer an
explanation to those who may not be familiar with its history.</p>

Persians. The famous <span class="smcap">Barmecides</span> were descended from a Persian noble
who had been superintendent of the Fire Temple at <span class="smcap">Balkh</span>. <span class="smcap">Afshin</span>, the
all-powerful favorite of the Caliph <span class="smcap">al-Mutasim</span>, was a scion of the
Princes of <span class="smcap">Usrushna</span> in Transoxiana."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dozy</span>, "Histoire de

and garments decorated with golden inscriptions were introduced, which
